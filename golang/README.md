# Golang Cross

This repository holds my custom docker image of golang build container.

It based on the alpine-glibc image by Vlad Frolov (frolvlad/alpine-glibc) for pre-compiled version of official golang distribution. With this image, you can build musl libc linked executables with glibc version of golang compiler.
